# 2018-11-19	Version 2.0.0-rc4

FreeRDP 2.0.0-rc4 is the fifth release candidate for 2.0.0. Although it mainly
addresses security and stability there are some new features as well.

Noteworthy features and improvements:

* fix multiple reported CVEs (#5031)
* gateway: multiple fixes and improvements (#3600, #4787, #4902, #4964, #4947,
  #4952, #4938)
* client/X11: support for rail (remote app) icons was added (#5012)
* licensing: the licensing code was re-worked. Per-device licenses
  are now saved on the client and used on re-connect.
	WARNING: this is a change in FreeRDP behavior regarding licensing. If the old
	behavior is required, or no licenses should be saved use the
	new command line option +old-license (#4979)
* improve order handling - only orders that were enabled
  during capability exchange are accepted (#4926).
	WARNING and NOTE: some servers do improperly send orders that weren't negotiated,
	for such cases the new command line option /relax-order-checks was added to
	disable the strict order checking. If connecting to xrdp the options
	/relax-order-checks *and* +glyph-cache are required.
* /smartcard has now support for substring filters (#4840)
  for details see https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/smartcard-logon
* add support to set tls security level (for openssl >= 1.1.0)
  - default level is set to 1
  - the new command line option /tls-seclevel:[LEVEL] allows to set
	  a different level if required
* add new command line option /smartcard-logon to allow
  smartcard login (currently only with RDP security) (#4842)
* new command line option: /window-position to allow positioning
  the window on startup (#5018)
* client/X11: set window title before mapping (#5023)
* rdpsnd/audin (mostly server side) add support for audio re-sampling using soxr or ffmpeg
