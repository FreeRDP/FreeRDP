# 2023-07-21 Version 3.0.0-beta1

We are pleased to announce the first beta release for the next stable 3.0
series of FreeRDP. It has been a huge endeavour to implement all the new
shiny bells and whistles as well as clean up the code base and we´re still
ironing out some smaller glitches.
This is the first API breaking change since the 2.0 series and there are
some adjustments to be made for existing applications.
See https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/FreeRDP3-migration-notes for
help (still incomplete)

Noteworthy changes:
* Support for AAD/AVD authentication
* Support for websocket transport
* Support smartcard authentication (TLS and NLA)
* Full smartcard emulation support (login with certificate + key)
* Rewritten proxy, new module API
* New reference client based on SDL2 (work in progress)
* Rewritten logging, now parsing issues are all writing to the log so
  that issues with protocol incompatibilities can be easier analyzed
  by just turning on logging
* Full OpenSSL 3 support
* Internal implementations for RC4, MD4 and MD5 (required for non critical
  parts in RDP but not part of more recend SSL libraries)
* Updated RDP protocol support
* Improved xfreerdp remote app support
* Reworked internal state machine for both client and server implementations
* Server implementations can now make use of connect-time network autodetection
* Improved clipboard handling, now also support server-to-client file transfer
  (currently xfreerdp only)
* EnhancedRemoteApp support: Utilizing the more modern standard allows remote
  apps with less glitches and window shadows
* Added client- and server-side handling for RDSTLS
* Support for the graphics redirection channel

git log 3.0.0-beta1..2.10.0
