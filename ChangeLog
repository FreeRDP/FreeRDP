git log 3.2.0...3.1.0

# 2023-12-22 Version 3.1.0

A new 3.1.0 minor release for the new 3.0.0 series.
This contains bugfixes, adds (better) support for libressl and mbedtls and
brings a bunch of improvements for the SDL client.

This comes with a price though, we now (optionally) require SDL_image if you
want to build the sdl-client

Since there are multiple new features, some new files (man pages) and new
optional dependencies we´ve directly incremented the minor version.

New CMake options:
* SDL_USE_COMPILED_RESOURCES (default ON) builds fonts and images into SDL
  client. Set to OFF to install these resources as files. (was already part of
  3.0.0, but worth mentioning here)
* WITH_SDL_IMAGE_DIALOGS (default OFF) Show some nice icons for SDL client
  connection dialogs. Requires SDL_image for build.
* WITH_BINARY_VERSIONING (default OFF) Similar as for libraries the binaries,
  manpages and resource locations created by FreeRDP project are postfixed
  with the API version. Recommended if packagers want to install the package
  alongside FreeRDP 2 without conflicts.
* RDTK_FORCE_STATIC_BUILD (default OFF) Build and link RDTK statically into
  shadow server. Recommended for packagers as this library is not really used
  outside of FreeRDP-shadow.
* UWAC_FORCE_STATIC_BUILD (default OFF) Build and link UWAC statically into
  wlfreerdp. Recommended for packagers as this library is not really used
  outside of wlfreerdp.

Noteworthy changes:
* Fix a nasty bug with relative mouse movement (#9677)
* LibreSSL support enhancements (#9691, #9670)
* mbedTLS support enhancements (#9662)
* Improve building on mac OS (#9641)
* New and improved manpages (#9690, #9650)
* Unify CMake common options, add (optional) binary versioning and allow
  building rdtk and uwac as static dependencies  (#9695)
* SDL client improvements (#9693, #9657, #9659, #9683, #9680, #9657, #9664,
  #9656)

git log 3.1.0...3.0.0

# 2023-12-12 Version 3.0.0

Final 3.0.0 release just a little over two weeks after the last 3.0.0-rc0.
This contains bugfixes, drops some legacy code, implements a small feature
request and adds some improvements to the build system.

Most notably is the new PreventInSourceBuilds.cmake which does exactly what
the name implies, it aborts builds where source equals build directory.
If you can not use out of source tree builds for some reason, you can
circumvent this measure with the CMake setting -DALLOW_IN_SOURCE_BUILD=ON

Noteworthy changes:
* add support for AF_VSOCK #9561
* xfreerdp drop X11 GDI implementation #9492
* fixed connection freeze with childSession #9594
* fixed relative mouse input issues #9608
* fixed issues with drive redirection #9610
* simplified mac build #9601
* fixed TSMF to build again #9603
* fixed command line /gfx parsing bug #9598
* prevent in source tree build #9550
* fixed various issues with settings #9595, #9596
* add E2K cpu support in WinPR #9599
* fixed wfreerdp DPI settings when used as embedded window #9593
* android add mouse hover support #9495

# 2023-07-21 Version 3.0.0-beta1

We are pleased to announce the first beta release for the next stable 3.0
series of FreeRDP. It has been a huge endeavour to implement all the new
shiny bells and whistles as well as clean up the code base and we´re still
ironing out some smaller glitches.
This is the first API breaking change since the 2.0 series and there are
some adjustments to be made for existing applications.
See https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/FreeRDP3-migration-notes for
help (still incomplete)

Noteworthy changes:
* Support for AAD/AVD authentication
* Support for websocket transport
* Support smartcard authentication (TLS and NLA)
* Full smartcard emulation support (login with certificate + key)
* Rewritten proxy, new module API
* New reference client based on SDL2 (work in progress)
* Rewritten logging, now parsing issues are all writing to the log so
  that issues with protocol incompatibilities can be easier analyzed
  by just turning on logging
* Full OpenSSL 3 support
* Internal implementations for RC4, MD4 and MD5 (required for non critical
  parts in RDP but not part of more recent SSL libraries)
* Updated RDP protocol support
* Improved xfreerdp remote app support
* Reworked internal state machine for both client and server implementations
* Server implementations can now make use of connect-time network autodetection
* Improved clipboard handling, now also support server-to-client file transfer
  (currently xfreerdp only)
* EnhancedRemoteApp support: Utilizing the more modern standard allows remote
  apps with less glitches and window shadows
* Added client- and server-side handling for RDSTLS
* Support for the graphics redirection channel
