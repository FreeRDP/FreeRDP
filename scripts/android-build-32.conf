# Note: This is a simple configuration to build all
#       architectures in one rush.
#       Since android 64 bit support was introduced with NDK API 21
#       this is the minimal common denominator.
#       If you require support for older NDK API levels,
#       create seperate configurations for each NDK API level
#       and architecture you want to support.
