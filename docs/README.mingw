Overview
========

FreeRDP can be built for Windows using llvm-mingw (https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) with both msvcrt and ucrt. 
MinGW builds are not actively mantained at the moment and every once in a while the build process may stop working. Pull requests to maintain MinGW support.

An example build system for LLVM-MinGW can be found here: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/tree/master/docs/mingw-example
