Action Script
.RS 4
executes a predefined script on key press\&.
Should the script not exist it is ignored\&.
Scripts can be provided at the default location
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/freerdp/action\&.sh\fR
or as command line argument
\fI/action:script:<path>\fR\&.
The script will receive the current key combination as argument\&.
The output of the script is parsed for
\fIkey\-local\fR
which tells that the script used the key combination, otherwise the combination is forwarded to the remote\&.
