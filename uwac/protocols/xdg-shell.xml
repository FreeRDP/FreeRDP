    <description summary="A desktop window">
      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides requests to treat surfaces like windows, allowing to set
      properties like maximized, fullscreen, minimized, and to move and resize
      them, and associate metadata like title and app id.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_surface state to take effect. Prior to committing the new
      state, it can set up initial configuration, such as maximizing or setting
      a window geometry.

      Even without attaching a buffer the compositor must respond to initial
      committed configuration, for instance sending a configure event with
      expected window geometry if the client maximized its surface during
      initialization.

      For a surface to be mapped by the compositor the client must have
      committed both an xdg_surface state and a buffer.

	The compositor shell will try to group application surfaces together

        purposes of aligning, placing and constraining windows.

        The window geometry is double buffered, and will be applied at the
        time wl_surface.commit of the corresponding wl_surface is called.

        Once the window geometry of the surface is set once, it is not

  <interface name="xdg_popup" version="1">
    <description summary="short-lived, popup surfaces for menus">
      A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface that can be
      used to implement menus. It takes an explicit grab on the surface
      that will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup. This can
      be done by the user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard,
      or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.

      When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out,
      and at the same time the surface will be unmapped. The xdg_popup
      object is now inert and cannot be reactivated, so clients should
      destroy it. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also
      dismiss the popup and unmap the surface.

      Clients will receive events for all their surfaces during this
      grab (which is an "owner-events" grab in X11 parlance). This is
      done so that users can navigate through submenus and other
      "nested" popup windows without having to dismiss the topmost
      popup.

      Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of
      their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
      request.

      The parent surface must have either an xdg_surface or xdg_popup
      role.

      Specifying an xdg_popup for the parent means that the popups are
      nested, with this popup now being the topmost popup. Nested
      popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
      in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times
      is the topmost one.

      If there is an existing popup when creating a new popup, the
      parent must be the current topmost popup.

      A parent surface must be mapped before the new popup is mapped.

      When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they will likely
      dismiss every nested popup as well. When a compositor dismisses
      popups, it will follow the same dismissing order as required
      from the client.

      The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
      where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
      local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
      xdg_shell.get_xdg_popup.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_popup state to take effect.

      For a surface to be mapped by the compositor the client must have
      committed both the xdg_popup state and a buffer.
