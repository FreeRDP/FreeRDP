.SH DESCRIPTION
.B winpr-makecert
is a tool for generating X.509 certificates modeled after the Windows command
MakeCert. winpr-makecert aims to be command line compatible with MakeCert
however not all options are supported or implemented yet.

Unimplemented features are not described here. They are marked as "Unsupported"
in winpr-makecerts help.

In contrast to it's Windows counterpart winpr\-makecert does, unless the
\fB\-live\fP option is given, always creates and save a certificate.
If \fIoutputname\fP isn't set it is tried to determine the host name of the
computer the command is run on.
.br
\fBWarning:\fP if the file already exists it will be overwritten without asking.

Without further options the generated certificates have the following properties:

* 2048 bit long
.br
* sha256 as hash algorithm
.br
* the detected host name is used as common name
.br
* a time stamp is used as serial number
.br
* validity period of one year
.br
* saved in the current working directory in crt format
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-rdp"
Dummy parameter. Can be used to quickly generate a certificate with default
properties without specifying any further parameters.
.IP "-silent"
Don't print the generated certificate to stdout.
.IP "-f format"
Three formats are supported: crt, pem and pfx.
.br
\fIcrt\fP outputs the key and the certificate in a separate file each with the file
endings .key and .crt.
.br
\fIpem\fP outputs the key and certificate into a single file with the file ending pem.
.br
And \fIpfx\fP outputs key and certificate into a  pkcs12 file with the ending .pfx.
.IP "-p password"
Password to use if the pfx format is used as format.
.IP "-live"
Don't write the key/certificate to disk. When used from the command line this
can be thought as "dummy" mode.
.IP "-n common_name"
The common name to use in the certificate.
.IP "-m months"
Validity period in months.
.IP "-y years"
Validity period in years. If months and years are specified the specified
month parameter will take precedence.
.IP "-len length"
Key length in bits to use.
.IP "-a { \fImd5\fP | \fIsha1\fP | \fIsha256\fP | \fIs384\fP | \fIsha512\fP }"
The hashing algorithm to use.
.IP "-# serial"
The serial number to use for the certificate.
.IP "-path"
A directory where the certificate should be created in.
.IP "outputname"
The base name of the created file(s). A suffix, the format specific suffix is
appended to this name.
.SH EXAMPLES
winpr-makecert -rdp

Creates a certificate with the default properties, saved to a file in the
current working directory in crt format named like the host. If the host is
named freerdp the created files are called freerdp.key and freerdp.crt. 


winpr-makecert -len 4096 -a sha384 -path /tmp -# 22 -m 144 -y 1 -format crt mycert

The command above creates the file /tmp/mycert.pem containing a key and a
certificate with a length of 4096. It will use sha384 as hash algorithm.
The certificate has the serial number 22 and is valid for 12 years (144 months).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful program execution.
.TP
.B 1
Otherweise.
